# Nelder-Mead-Simplex-
The Nelderâ€“Mead method (also downhill simplex method, amoeba method, or polytope method) is a commonly applied numerical method used to find the minimum or maximum of an objective function in a multidimensional space. It is a direct search method (based on function comparison) and is often applied to nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives may not be known.
