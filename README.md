# Nelder-Mead-Simplex-
The Nelderâ€“Mead method (also downhill simplex method, amoeba method, or polytope method) is a commonly applied numerical method used to find the minimum or maximum of an objective function in a multidimensional space. It is a direct search method (based on function comparison) and is often applied to nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives may not be known. 

The basic algorithm is quite simple to understand and very easy to use. For these reasons, it is very popular in many fields of science and technology, especially in chemistry and medicine.

The method does not require any derivative information, which makes it suitable for problems with non-smooth functions. It is widely used to solve parameter estimation and similar statistical problems, where the function values are uncertain or subject to noise. It can also be used for problems with discontinuous functions, which occur frequently in statistics and experimental mathematics.
